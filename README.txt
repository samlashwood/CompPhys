The given problems can be solved by running the code file named by the subject of the problem. 
The printed outputs of the files explicitly answer the problems.
Please note that the Interpolation output inculdes the output of the Matrix_Solving file; please ignore this and simply examine the plot of interpolated data.
Please also note that an extra histogram for the Random_Number_generation problem is produced: the comparison method using a constant comparison function- this was inculkded for completeness.

Python 3 was chosen as the language in which to solve the problems due to the vast number of useful additional modules (such as numpy), the legability of raw code, and the author's flunecy in this language
The style of coding was chosen to be relatively easy to read - it is not optimized fully for this reason and time constraints. 
The formulae given in lectures were implemented where appropriate using iterative loops to implement sums and construct matrices.

This task recieved a first at 75%
